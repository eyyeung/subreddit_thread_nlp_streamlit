I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s. Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?

I’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm).

That is literally a cover up.\n\nI get that in this situation a lot is going on. The cop is stressed and likely afraid for her own safety to some degree and her adrenaline is high. I can even see how, in the moment, she could mistake her shot for the suspect shooting. But once the scene is cleared, and things have calmed down and she can see things rationally, there\'s no way that she, or the other cops involved, could have simply ""not realized"" that she was the one that shot her partner. That means that she and the other cops involved all reported that the suspect initially shot. They all reported it in a way that made her fatal shooting justified, and to cast the suspect in a worse light. That is literally a cover up. \n\nYes, she made a mistake, but she still tried to cover up that mistake. There can be an ongoing investigation and a cover up simultaneously.\n\nYou\'re absolutely right that resisting arrest is not the best thing to do.

bn8vce,Thoughts so far about GoodNotes 5,"Over the last few years I have jumped between GoodNotes, NoteShelf and real note books. Until now. I think this new version of GoodNotes, especially when the new version rolls out for the Mac, is just about spot on.

The writing isn’t quite as smooth as one or two other apps I have used on the iPad Pro but it’s acceptable. The feature set is getting better all the time and having the tabs at the top combined with a quick drop down list and a full document library view, it has so many excellent user friendly features.

So why not 5 stars in the Apple App Store?

It’s almost perfect but few things in life are truly perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Like wouldn’t it be great to be able to hide the tool bar while writing if we wanted to? I’d also like to have smoother writing (Noteshelf and even Microsoft’s OneDrive app write smoother). I’d also like to be able to customise the toolset to have what I regularly use in the order I want them (I never use shapes, photos or camera so I’d love to replace those icons with more quick access pen colours, for example).

So, for now, it’s a 4. Well, maybe a 4.5 really but that’s not an option in the App Store, unfortunately. 😀

Thank you GoodNotes team for continuing to develop this great app.

Martin","[""They finally added half point increases in pen thickness. 3 was way too thin and 4 was way to thick. 3.5 is just right.\n\nIt's getting better every update.\n\nGive it time and it'll be on par if not better than GN4 and notability."", 'Just comparing GN4 with GN5, GN4 blows GN5 out of the water. I used GN4 for almost a year before GN5 was released and I NEVER had an issue with it. I\'m so incredibly disappointed with the release of GN5. I downloaded GN5 the day it came out and was so stoked but I quickly realized that it had been released too early. Even the Goodnotes team admits that they didn\'t want to wait any longer to release it, which to me implies that they rushed at the end. From the majority of the people I have talked to the disappointment is stemming from the developers. I\'ve reached out to them once and their response to me was basically \'be patient or switch to GN4\' which is basically impossible after using GN5 for any period of time since you can\'t back import your notebooks to GN4 from GN5. On top of the fact that they removed basic functions from GN4 and have yet to bring them back. Their blog says that these features will be reimplemented ""soon"" which at this point I have no faith that it will happen. Simple features like the tool shortcuts in the zoom window or being able to set a right margin should never have been removed in the first place. Not to mention that every time an update is released, they\'re updating shit that doesn\'t matter or whatever bug they\'re claiming to fix doesn\'t actually get resolved. The developers have severely disappointed a large portion of their loyal followers and they aren\'t doing much to make us feel better. So that\'s probably why it doesn\'t have 5 stars in the Apple App Store.', 'Wow! I certainly hadn’t noticed so much change as you have. Perhaps I only use functions that have been carried over to version 5 so I’ve not experienced the disappointment that you have. I must admit, I was nit a huge user of version 4 as Noteshelf and real paper notebooks were my preference until GN5.', 'Exactly, there’s only so many times you can hear ‘just wait, we’re working on it’ before you just get fed up. I’m still waiting for non-iCloud back-up and the zoom window shortcuts too. There probably are bugs that we don’t notice are getting fixed but it just feels like there hasn’t been progress for so long. The bug that I *really* need to get fixed is when I’m zooming in to a document sometimes it snaps back out and I have to zoom in again, and vice versa when I’m trying to zoom out. And there’s more that I can’t even think of right now. \n\nI do use GN5 and I like it, as broken as it, but it definitely doesn’t deserve 5 stars as it is. I think it will be a 5 star app when it’s finished, but who knows how long that would take. At the moment it kinda seems like we’re beta testing the app fpr them honestly.', ""I use full sized posters as my note taking template pages. GN4 can handle notebooks filled with these with relative ease. GN5 crashes within minutes of trying to handle only a few of these. I am a grad student and I take notes exclusively on my ipad and have been all through undergrad, so over 5 years now total. GN4 is fantastic while GN5 is an objectively worse version in performance, utility, and ease of use. Sure its got some minor upgrades here and there but the important aspects all suck in comparison.

It has major rendering issues with any relatively large pdf. If you bring this issue up to the the developers they’ll just ask for the diagnostic report and suggest you switch back to GN4. I know it’s something they’re actively trying to fix but the updates they’ve released relating to PDFs hasn’t really fixed much.', 'I have also had problems with it deleting some of my notes when I switch between files. I think if they fix the bugs and add all the old features, like backup in drive, then GN5 would be great.', 'Terrible performance/speed in GN5.  I think they switched to a monolithic sql database and it slows down dramatically as notebooks get larger.  With 50-100 pages of handwritten notes it becomes much slower.\n\nGN5 doesn\'t cache page images, it re-renders a page even when nothing on the page has changed.   If I am writing on page 75, the first 74 are not likely to change, so they should have been cached as images rather than re-rendering all pen strokes each time I look at them.  Slow scrolling.\n\nThe Zoom window lacks tools to switch colors and they say they aren\'t going to bring them back.  It is so inefficient dragging your hand to the top toolbar to switch colors (and putting the toolbar at the bottom is a nuisance).  Cut and paste and many other things can\'t be performed within the zoom, it must be closed and re-opened to do simple things.\n\nRepeatedly clicking things is inefficient.    Time wasted playing around with the software interface rather than getting things done!\n\nAnother example is converting handwriting to text. It is much easier in Noteshelf 2.   Unfortunately Noteshelf doesn\'t have vertical scrolling.\n\nThe developers just don\'t seem to ""get it"" anymore, and this is 5 or 6 months after GN5 release.

I use this a lot so I have to keep coming back to it. Existing PDF bookmarks have been reinstated with inscrutable, uneditable, unchangeable names. The recommendation from GN Support was ""Speak to the orginal PDF author."" I am the original PDF author.

e2m2ao,Some suggestions and improvements for Goodnotes 5,"Hi there

I have had GN5 installed on my iPad for a while now, and have come across some things that could be improved

1) The app seems kind of slow and laggy when scrolling through documents, especially if there is a fair bit written on a page

2) Writing occasionally disappears and then reappears

3) The colour code doesn't show the one of the colour currently selected. It always shows FFEEFF

4) Squared paper isn't sized how it should be compared to actual paper. On real paper you have squares that are 5mm wide and tall. The closest I have seen is the ""squared paper"" template, with 5,75mm intervals

5) Pen sizes in GN4 and GN5 use different systems. A ""1"" in GN4 is approximately a ""0,2mm"" in GN5, while a text marker ""10"" in GN4 is a ""2mm"" in GN5. Am i correct in assuming a 1=0.2 ratio?

I would be happy if someone were to look at these things and appreciate any response. Thank you.","['Is it still not possible to drag selected text to another side in the same document? If not then that should be pretty high on the to-do list. \n\nNow I have to copy/paste every time, it works but feels so unnecessary for an app like this.', ""I honestly haven't tried it that way and have always copy pasted if necessary.\n\nI think GN5 can be quite an improvement to GN4, but for now I will continue to use GN4"", 'I want URLs for docs, folders, pages and bookmarks.', 'One thing I can’t stand about Good Notes (and every other note taking app except for Apple Notes) is that there isn’t an option for a pencil that fully functions like an actual pencil. Good Notes doesn’t even have a pencil, and Notability has one but it doesn’t act much like a pencil but more like the ball point pen in Good Notes. I like the pencil to be pressure sensitive (I mean really really pressure sensitive), and I like it to look and shade like a real pencil. I don’t think that will EVER happen.\n\nIt annoys me, because I like certain things about each of the note taking apps, and I wish they’d make an app with all of it combined into one. I’ll start to think that I really really like a note taking app, and then one little thing will throw me so off that it disgusts me. Lol. I guess the cons outweigh the pros is what I’m trying to say, and it is very bothersome. I believe there are a lot of issues with copyright, and so that’s why they don’t all have the same features.\n\nI really like Apple Notes, but when I go to put my palm on the screen it goes crazy, highlights everything I’ve written, and if I’m not careful I’ll accidentally hit delete. You can undo it now, but think about how horrific it was when you couldn’t retrieve all of the notes that just took you hours to write!!!!!\n\nGood Notes feels very basic to me. I’m not sure why, but it’s just like their tools are very basic. There is pressure sensitivity on the pens, but its finicky. It only want’s to do a basic stroke instead of a real time pressure sensitive one (if you know what I mean). The shape section is so annoying to me too. I can’t actually insert a shape from a drop down menu (if I can I haven’t seen how to yet), and I think it’s kind of strange that you have to draw the shape. It takes a million tries to get it perfect and the way you want it to be. You can’t resize it after it’s done. Then stuff with files, drag and drop, etc.There are so many little things that nag at me, but that’s a few of them.\n\nEventually I get so mad I switch to another note taking app. I’ll use that one for a while, get mad at all of the issues with that one and switch to another one, and repeat. It’s an annoying dance I’ve been doing for a while.', ""I use GN5 on a 2019 iPad Pro. I've used it a lot for handwritten notes: several hundred hours.\n\n1. I've never seen this -- could be because of the iPad I'm using. I've noticed lag on my iPad mini 4 occasionally, but... I've not seen what you're talking about, more that sometimes the screen will be blank for a bit before rendering. But that is an older iPad.\n2. I have never seen this. I've handwritten more than a thousand pages. What model iPad are you using? I think that might be the difference.\n3. I've never seen this, Trying it now I can't get that to happen.\n4. Goodnotes is a little frustrating in this way. It \\*always\\* scales the paper to fit in on the screen so you're basically never seeing the paper at 100% zoom. It is always larger or smaller than 100%. The only way around this is to make your own templates that are carefully measured to exactly match the editable screen size on your device. I've done this for the iPad 11 Pro with the Graphics app. It's not that hard to to do but it isn't easy. I agree that this is frustrating. At the very least they should put a 100% zoom control somewhere so that you can get things properly sized regardless of paper size.\n5. I don't understand what you are saying, but I suspect that you're seeing something similar to #4 but regarding pen diameter. The pen diameter is dependent on how zoomed the current document is. A 2mm pen will only appear to be 2mm if the doc is at 100% zoom, which is problematic (see #4.) This too can be fixed by making your own templates and always using them: you will have consistent pen width. Otherwise as you switch between different page sizes the pen will seem thicker and finer, which is confusing.\n\nIn the future it would be very helpful for you to post you iPad model and what version of iOS you are running when asking this kind of thing. Cheers."", ""Once I figured out that Goodnotes wants the template that you're writing on to be \\*exactly\\* the size of the editable area of the screen and made me own templates it has been pretty remarkable. The pressure sensitivity and line width are zoom-dependent, so the pen will have less sensitivity and a finer line on a page that is larger than your screen and is therefore zoomed down and will be fatter and much more pressure sensitive on a page size that is smaller than the screen and zoomed in. It is confusing and annoying.\n\nBut I do wish that GN had the Apple Notes pen/pencil tools and could make links to documents and pages that I could use in other apps to go right to a spot in a specific document.\n\nI would use Apple Notes if it had a good PDF annotation function. I'm hopeful that they will add it."", 'Omg, I didn’t know that!  \nI wish they’d make links too.\n\nAbout Apple Notes and PDF annotation, OMG! That’s one reason that I bought Good Notes. I can not stand that you have to “mark up” a PDF to write on it. I hate it, and it’s so hard to do in Apple Notes because you have to scroll with two fingers to scroll down the PDF. It goes all crazy and out of whack, and it makes pencil marks with my fingers and does all kinds of stuff that I don’t want it to do. There is a lag when I mark up a PDF, and I’ll draw (for example) a circle, and it lags horribly. It will put the circle in the wrong place, and once I lift my pen it will jump to where I was originally trying to draw it.\n\nThere are so many ##little## things that all of these note taking apps need to work out, lol. It’s killing me.', ""1) I am using a 10.5 inch iPad Pro with everything updated to the current version, so I shouldn't have any issues regarding performance either. The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. \n\n2) I will try to recreate that. \n\n3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code 123456. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me #123456 but #FFEEFF\n\n4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.\n\n5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals. In GN5 you go from 0.1mm to 2mm in 0.05mm intervals."", ""The CPU on 2019 Pros is &gt;= 2x the CPU on the 10.5, which may be a factor. Have you tried to scroll the same docs on the built in PDF viewer to see if performance is similar? I can get something like what you're saying to only occasionally happen on an iPad that has 1/4 the CPU of the 10.5. Maybe it is a memory issue?\n\n3. I can reproduce -- you should report this as a bug! Good catch.\n\n4. Are you using the non-pressure sensitive pen? If you are and you set it to 5mm it should be 5mm no matter what zoom you are at. It sounds like you might enjoy creating your own templates. The Autodesk Graphic application makes this very easy to do."", ""I'd like the ability to hide the top-level navigation bar (above the tool bar). I'd prefer to have the screen real-estate back and pull the top-level bar down when I need it; seems a bit distracting.

I would like to think that they are working on it but to be honest there’s *still* tons of features that need to be brought over from GN5 from GN4. \n\nI agree with you on presentation mode, I’m not against it per se but I have no idea why they decided to work on it when there’s some many other features that more people were asking for. \n\nAuto backup has been on the beta of GN5 for a while now.

I still use both, GN offers me a better way to customize my notes at home, but in classes I go only with notability.', 'I’m pretty sure they’re not even working on it. They’re aware people want it, but you’re asking for a pretty fundamentally new feature. It’s not reasonable to expect an app to be something other than what it was created to be. \n\nI personally have no use for audio recording and would much rather the team spend time fixing bugs and adding different features that are closer to the core features of GoodNotes. You’re not entitled to direct the development priorities of the whole team because you spent 8 bucks on an app.', 'Presentation mode was important because it was a feature of GN4, and GN4 is going to stop working soon. I use Presentation mode and Auto-backup every day for work. I assure you that there were more people complaining about the lack of Presentation mode in GN5, perhaps just not in such public ways.\n\nGN5 is a ground-up rewrite that was necessary to support new APIs in iOS, macOS, and web services. They needed to get it out so they could support those, and also to sell enough copies to support future development. Since then, they have prioritized feature parity with GN4 to support longtime GN users who use all of the features that had to be removed in the transition. For what it’s worth, Apple did the same thing several years ago with the iWork suite, and it took _years_ to get all the features back. And it’s only in the last couple major releases that they have added significant new features. Obviously, Apple has a lot more money and a lot bigger audience than GoodNotes. \n\nMy point is: you can’t expect the team to drop all the plans to support current features to build a _huge_ new feature just because you personally would find it valuable.', ""It is not about me getting what I want. It's about the Goodnotes team listening to their customers and responding accordingly. We, not just me, have been asking for this for 2 years. It is the most requested feature according to Goodnotes own feature request website."", 'That doesn’t mean that it’s the most important.', ""What will make it mean that it's the most important feature in your opinion aside from thousands of their users voting it to the no 1 priority on their own feature forum then ? \n\nOops, that has already been done mb. The whole point about the community complaining is that they are always pushing what the users ask aside and follow their own agenda, while pretending to be listening to the users. \n\nInstead of working on the actual important features that many of us have asked they have went to create tons of useless and unfinished products like the mac app which is full of bugs and errors  along with the fact that the app still does not support auto cloud syncing aside from with icloud. Now you tell me if this is not embarassing ?"", 'The Mac app is another thing that predates GN5 that needs to be there to support longtime users. There are a lot of decisions that developers make, and they aren’t exclusively tied to customer feedback forums. They also have to weigh the cost to develop and maintain those features, the design complexity they add, and more. I hope they _never_ add audio recording because it would take the focus away from other features. That’s not a feature request box to tick, and that’s just one reason why the feature request forum is just _one_ of many factors that go into software development.', 'Your workflow is genius, thank you for sharing it']",Any update on when audio recording will come to Goodnotes?Audio recording is the only feature that is keeping me from using Goodnotes.

And then I feel like when I explain that I feel that way, it’s going to make him feel worse so I debate on saying something or not. It’s a vicious cycle.', 'Pardon the length, wanted to make sure my numbers were right. The reference to the $400k is a perfect example in that it is extreme, and it wasn\'t just top leadership. The highest paid officer WAS patrol and he made $414,543.06 (in 2019). It\'s not a dishonest argument and it is all publicly available data. The fact that this was even possible and that there isn\'t a system in place to prevent this is unacceptable. Do you honestly think otherwise? I hope you never complain about taxes ;)  The Seattle Times said ""For example, the median for officers who worked at least 1,000 hours was $167,000."" The avg working year is 2000 hours, so that means there are a lot of officers who make over $167k with full benefits and taxpayer backed pensions. A Forbes report from last year states that the avg US salary for a police officer is $67,600. So Seattle officers, on AVERAGE, are paid $100,000 dollars more per year. I openly acknowledge there are additional considerations such as cost of living but there is no angle in which someone can argue in good faith that these officers are not well compensated. They should be well compensated but within reason and competitively.\n\nNow, my opinion is that the officers are leaving because they don\'t feel respected or appreciated. They are here to serve the community and right now that community is critical of them. Instead of taking stock of what truths may exist and how to bridge that gap, there has been some outright rejection of service to the community. It\'s basically a threat, accept us as we are no matter what we do or we may just stand by and let your community deteriorate. If a group has the power to legally take a life on behalf of the community, that community should absolutely hold that group to a very high standard. That is why they do deserve to be paid well. Same as why we hold medical professionals to a higher standard. When a job includes having people\'s lives in your hands it is very important that they get it right, every single time.\n\nAs for the de-fund police argument, it\'s a slogan, it\'s meant to be provocative. If calm normal community conversation provided the solutions people were seeking, that slogan may not have been so prevalent. My point stands that in the light of day, the average person wants more focus on mental health resources being the first responders (in applicable scenarios) to manage the response in a different way. If funding is the reason we can\'t have it, then a natural place to make adjustments is from what it would be replacing. That slogan was meant to force a conversation and it did. Sadly real change can\'t happen without some friction and forced uncomfortable conversations.\n\nThe same folks arguing all protesters are rioters are often the ones saying one bad apple doesn\'t spoil the whole bunch when it comes to police. I agree with that. But what we have seen again and again (nationally) is the blue wall and that police will back those bad apples to the bitter end. The bad apples aren\'t even fired in most cases, let alone held accountable to their community. That\'s a choice and if they choose to stand together then they should expect to fall together in the eyes of the community. The discomfort they feel is meant to inspire them to adjust that mentality, not abandon their responsibilities in retaliation. Neither plan has worked and no one is happy so maybe it makes sense to reset the table and people on both sides to start to show up with solutions instead of knee-jerk defensiveness and raw hostility.

I couldn't remember where I heard that name before so I dropped it. \n\nOne day my mum was looking through dramas to watch but got distracted with something so she left the TV on the drama selecting screen. Idk how else to phrase that lol. I saw my id is gangnam beauty and saw eunwoo on the front. He looked so familiar to me but I still didn't remember where I saw him. Once again, I dropped it.\n\nI was starting to get interested in kpop in 2019. Not enough to stan any groups. Just to listen to a couple title tracks and watch a couple kpop related videos. I watched a compilation of mvs. Still don't remember what the title was but I skipped through the video and ended up watching a part of all night. It was the choreography scene and I only watched a tiny bit of it. Saw the name astro, thought it looked familiar but once again, I didn't bother looking into it.\n\nSaw Rocky's mask inspired dance in my recommended for days. Finally clicked on it and watched a bit of it. Wasn't into watching dancing at the time but he somehow managed to make me watch it. Afterwards, I slowly started watching dance videos. Rocky's magic honestly.\n\nWas watching some kpop video. Honestly don't remember what I was about when I read a comment that said astro's eunwoo was friends with bts. Also read about that in some article.\n\nThen I stumbled across the poster for true beauty's drama. I was a webtoon reader and my favourite character was suho. I saw the poster and immediately thought he looked familiar but I still didn't know where I had seen him. I wasn't into kdramas at the time so I didn't bother watching it. \n\nThen I found a true beauty interview in my recommended while I was using YouTube. I watched it because I was curious and they had a question on astro. Found it familiar again and this time, I finally gave in and looked them up. Watched the all night performance video thinking it was the mv. I'm stupid I know. Then I watched their reaction to it and absolutely fell for the chaos. Also realised I didn't watch the mv. So I watched the mv, loved the aesthetics. Watched their pool party video then found a link to the cicada video in the comment section. Subscribed to their YouTube channel immediately and watched the videos YouTube would recommend to me. \n\nI watched all their mvs and wondered why most of their songs/mvs were so familiar. Then I made the connection one day. Don't know why it took me so long honestly. The more I got into them, the more I realised I missed so many chances to become an aroha earlier.

fsm63y,Goodnotes 5 is falling behind Noteshelf 2 on a crucial feature.,"I love Goodnotes 5. I think it’s powerful and very good in giving people the ability to organize notes and offering the templates people can use in their everyday needs. But there is one small feature that a rival note taking app has that I hope the developer for Goodnotes looks at seriously for improvement. Noteshelf 2 is another handwriting app which in my opinion is quietly gaining on the big 2 - Goodnotes and Notability especially because it’s introduced a handy little feature people are ignoring  - giving people the ability to adjust the line spacing while writing handwritten notes.

You might smirk and sneer at this but if you are using blank paper templates with no lines when jotting down notes - you wouldn’t laugh when looking back on your own writing and seeing your handwritten notes veering off wildly downward or upwards slanted in such a way you might lose track of your own train of thought. Well, Noteshelf 2 has Goodnotes by the shorthairs on this one because the developer was clever enough to foresee this issue and introduced the line adjustment feature built into its zoom box writing utility. Noteshelf 2 lets you see the line you’re writing on in the zoom box so wherever you’re actually writing on the page you simply write your sentence on the given line in the zoom box. This allows you to always write your notes in a straight line even on blank paper with no lines. Not only that but Noteshelf 2 lets the user adjust the spacing of the line so this way you can squeeze the notes you write onto smaller surface areas when dropping down to the next line. 

Goodnotes only gives the user a simple zoom box magnification mode letting you write in the box. But this doesn’t prevent you from veering off course if you write on unlined paper. This is the one area I hope the developer of Goodnotes looks into and copies Noteshelf 2’s clever feature to make it possible for people to write sentences in straight lines on unlined blank paper. Just my two cents.","[""Agree.  You know, I've never understood why folks only ask about Goodnotes/Notability when Noteshelf 2 is on par and in some ways superior to both.

Once in a while I delete the whole folder where these images or screenshots are located in my computer.\n\nI use GoodNotes in full screen and the files app floating hidden on the right. When I have to paste an image from the PC I slide to the left from the right side of the screen to show the files app and then I drag n drop the image. The photo is in GoodNotes in less than three seconds.\n\nI may seem a little bit tricky but once it's set up, it works perfectly and saves me a lot of time. Specially during virtual classes.\n\nI don't know if Macs have the option to share like this by default. If it doesn't, then you can try setting up your computer as a samba server. I've done this in Linux and it works the same way. There are really good guides on how to set this up.

We’re not backing down from this fight, and we’ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives.”\n\nCalifornia has led the nation in passing gun safety laws, having pioneered statewide protections approved by voters in Proposition 63 to ban possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring background checks to keep ammunition out of the hands of dangerous people. Since assuming office, Governor Newsom has signed multiple bills aimed at reducing gun violence, including strengthening gun violence restraining orders and regulating the sale of firearms and ammunition. Governor Newsom also worked with the Legislature to accelerate the regulation of ‘ghost guns’ to crack down on the use of untraceable firearms by criminals.

gh9m46,Goodnotes takes up a lot of storage,"Hello everyone,

I'm having problems with Goodnotes 5 on my iPad. For information: I work on the 11"" iPad Pro 2019 with 64 GB.

When I bought the iPad last year I thought that the storage should definitely be enough, since I'm saving my stuff mostly in clouds.

But I'm currently experiencing issues with the storage and I feel like they are caused by Goodnotes.

Today, while I was working on my notes, I had notifications that the storage is full and I should empty my trashcan (I honestly dont know if this is the correct word for it, but I use the german version and its basically trashcan in it). I did so and the took a look into my system settings and it said that Goodnotes is taking up 23GB of storage! I then checked my goodnotes backup, which I keep in my onedrive and all the files are only 1.7GB big.

I restarted my iPad and in the system settings it said that Goodnotes is now only taking up 1.7GB of space. 

I was happy and thought that the problem is solved.

I'm having problems with Goodnotes 5 on my iPad. For information: I work on the 11"" iPad Pro 2019 with 64 GB.

When I bought the iPad last year I thought that the storage should definitely be enough, since I'm saving my stuff mostly in clouds.

But I'm currently experiencing issues with the storage and I feel like they are caused by Goodnotes.

Today, while I was working on my notes, I had notifications that the storage is full and I should empty my trashcan (I honestly dont know if this is the correct word for it, but I use the german version and its basically trashcan in it). I did so and the took a look into my system settings and it said that Goodnotes is taking up 23GB of storage! I then checked my goodnotes backup, which I keep in my onedrive and all the files are only 1.7GB big.

I restarted my iPad and in the system settings it said that Goodnotes is now only taking up 1.7GB of space. 

I was happy and thought that the problem is solved.

But now I worked on my notes again for maybe 90 minutes and now Goodnotes takes up 10GB again.

I dont know what to do to solve this problem, so I hope maybe one of you can help me.

gzt6vm,Interesting update today in Goodnotes 5.4.27,"A new release is out today. The most interesting fix involves optimizations to reduce storage sizes in Goodnotes. I don't know if this is referring to the PDF file sizes issue but it appears to be anything but the PDF question because it simply talks about optimizations. Otherwise this fix would have specifically mentioned the PDF issue explicitly. Another interesting fix is they've replaced the dark Cornell template because it was ""misaligned"". They also fixed synching problems. But the big one is now you can export your Goodnotes documents as a zip file but only if you choose image as the file type. I don't know how this works and I'll need to test this ability.","['Orange county is beautiful,  Elkhart is not.', 'I was gonna say Lillard but then I looked up MVP voting and Payton has had better rankings in MVP voting than Lillard has so that along with all his accolades imma say the Glove.', 'It would be nice to have an adult beverage with all the Chicago prep, keep in mind H2O is an adult beverage.

Like a whole new world hahaha (cue little mermaid song from disney) Happy creating!""]","iPad Japanese notebookHello guys,  I've been learning Japanese and looking for everywhere to find the digital version of Japanese study notebook. Could not find what I am looking for so I made a Japanese notebook for beginners. We worked really hard on the design and to make it user friendly.

I would appreciate if you could take a look :)

i5sf86,Best workflow tool ever!," 

So I am left Handed and have constant wrist pain, so I am always looking for something that will make me to things faster. I saw and old post here where someone built a custom Bluetooth Keyboard but me not being super useful with my hands I decided to look in the internet and see if I could find something that I liked and was functional.

Found those tiny Macropads where you can easily modify the keys with key combinations and that looked great. while navigating google images to see different models I found one with a Knob! a KNOB!! that is genius, sadly it seemed like it was a version that was out of stock navigated reddit to see if someone had a used one. Finally found a guy that made them, I asked him tons of questions such as if it would work with an ipad and was it hard to program etc.

He sent me videos and tutorials I said yeah why not. let's do it, I am not a techie person so setting up the whole thing so I could program the keyboard took me 2 hours, got the keypad today, flashed the file I did, it works like a charm. it is not fancy like the bluetooth one, but it uses USB C, and I just used a short one I had laying there (USB c to USB C)

anyways you can see it here

So I am left Handed and have constant wrist pain, so I am always looking for something that will make me to things faster. I saw and old post here where someone built a custom Bluetooth Keyboard but me not being super useful with my hands I decided to look in the internet and see if I could find something that I liked and was functional.

Found those tiny Macropads where you can easily modify the keys with key combinations and that looked great. while navigating google images to see different models I found one with a Knob! a KNOB!! that is genius, sadly it seemed like it was a version that was out of stock navigated reddit to see if someone had a used one. Finally found a guy that made them, I asked him tons of questions such as if it would work with an ipad and was it hard to program etc.

He sent me videos and tutorials I said yeah why not. let's do it, I am not a techie person so setting up the whole thing so I could program the keyboard took me 2 hours, got the keypad today, flashed the file I did, it works like a charm. it is not fancy like the bluetooth one, but it uses USB C, and I just used a short one I had laying there (USB c to USB C)

anyways you can see it here

and here is the layout I use for Procreate and GoodNotes, pressing the knob changes the profile

She ignores his messages even more than the kids do which is why we usually send reminders directly to the kids. I later learned from youngest SS that BM lost it and started yelling at the kids about me texting with them. She, once again, manipulated them into thinking that they hurt her simply by replying to me. She also checks their phones when they are with her so they feel the need to ""protect her feelings"" by pretending they always ignore me. I now completely understand why they don\'t respond to texts. SD still texts me for literally everything any other time of the year, but she goes ghost when with BM.

iueigw,How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5?,"**TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen?","[""I'm a PhD student and have imported 10-15 books, 70 (so far) articles and book chapters, several notebooks for notetaking (about 100 pages each), probably 30 annotated PDF lectures on my iPad. Once I import any PDF into Goodnotes, the app saves it in the .goodnotes format. And I save and backup all files in the Goodnotes format.  I only export my notes to PDF for storage on Dropbox once I'm satisfied that doc needs no further edits.  Using this method, I'm at 8GB of storage.  However, if Goodnotes adds audio recordings (I can only dream), then I can imagine my library size swelling.\n\nI was kidding myself when I said I would use only Goodnotes on the Ipad.  It turns out Dropbox (for backing up), Procreate (to aid with diagrams) and the Iphoto library (where my screenshots from lecture material or internet go), Notability, and Anki take up another 30 gigs easily.  \n\nI've never experienced a lag on the ipad (except when certain PDF books were graphics intense).  Keep it organised from the start and the incremental backups, won't take long. You've already invested so much in law school already, just spend a few more hundred and never have to worry about this again.  Good luck"", ""So helpful, thanks so much! Some of the textbooks are really long (1k pages) but those ones aren't graphics heavy, just fat slabs of text, and then all my anatomy textbooks are full of pictures and diagrams but I only use one per semester so I'll be able to move the ones I don't need off the device if need be. I think it'll end up being okay. And my slide decks are provided by the University in .pdf format so that's really good! I'm glad the iPad doesn't lag too much once it's full"", ""Thank you so much for this, I hadn't even considered that GN goes though iCloud.. I had an old apple ID when I was quite a bit younger and iCloud's free 15GB filled up so quickly with just photos. And yes I did want my iPad and MBA to talk to each other the same way OneNote syncs across all my devices. I think I would have run into the full cloud storage issue much quicker with OneNote but my institution gives 1TB storage to all students and that's why I haven't noticed things filling up. Seriously thanks 100x for letting me know""]","How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5?**TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish.

Honestly the best notes are what you feel is most efficient and effective.', 'I’ve been writing my notes and converting them to text. Handwriting is a lot faster for me during class, but to make my notes look nice for studying and reviewing later I use the conversion tool and then highlight and underline after. I still keep my handwritten notes, just putting the conversions in a separate note or different page. This is for my iPad, but since I have the same Apple ID on my Mac, I have been testing it out. Not all the features are as good on the Mac, but I love being able to type my notes with a keyboard.\n\nDefinitely agree with the other comments of using the zoom window and dotted paper. I use dotted paper even if I’m typing in order to line everything up nicely', ""Use squared paper. It will help you keep the text aligned vertically.

Just keep equal spaces between letters and it would look much better."", 'I’ve been told my handwriting in GoodNotes is really pretty, so here’s what I do:\n- No screen protector or nib protector of any kind, bc the smoothness really helps my letters glide \n- I use the ballpoint pen in size 0.35mm, which works out really nice and it’s around the size of my fine liners IRL \n- I use the zoom window, bc the advance ahead feature helps keep my writing consistent bc if I zoom out and move to another area the tilt of my writing is wayyyyy different lol\n- My strokes are all a little faster, like my hands get really shaky so quickly pulling the strokes helps the entire letter stay smooth\nAnd I’m left-handed, not sure if that helps 😊', 'I use Notability for my handwritten notes then transfer them to GoodNotes.

So fountain 100%%% I also use a somewhat thin pen size. Nothing more than 0.25-0.3. I also don’t use highlighting just different colored pens. And I personally don’t use window because I like my letters to look a bit bigger so I just slightly zoom in using a A5 template.\n\nI also noticed that my handwriting looks better with white ink black paper.

When I search for a single number like 1 or 3 nothing comes up.  I searched for a word next to the number - and it does recognize it as a number.  i.e.\n\n1 love - search for 1 doesn\'t find it.  Search for love and the 1 shows up converted in the search.  So it definitely finds and transcribes numbers.\n\nSo then I tried writing a 12 as neatly as possible - boom it shows up - so somehow a single number or letter search doesn\'t work.  I also tried searching for the letter ""a"" - and that turned up nothing but ""an"" showed a bunch.\n\nSo maybe try writing 01 02 and 03 - I did that and the search found those.

I am wondering if someone can help me.

I am making a sticker book in GoodNotes but i am having issues with making the stickers the same size and keeping them lined up properly.

Each sticker is an individual png and is pre cropped so that people can move them freely. 

So im not able to align them somewhere else and save a whole page of stickers because they need to remain independent.

So when i drag a png and drop them in  GoodNotes they end up different sizes. 
( Even though they were created the same size. )

This makes them all look disheveled no matter how i try to make it look nice.

Is there a way to make the stickers the same size in Goodnotes?

Is there an alignment tool so i know everything is straight?

While I enjoy the Drive forms, I also still enjoy the gameplay when I'm not using them. Basic combat feels responsive and the player still has other options. I don't think the gameplay feels restrictive for them to be locked off here and there, especially if that's part of the challenge of the segment. ...And when it comes to the Pride Lands, you have to adopt entirely different gameplay mechanics anyway and that's always going to be up to the individual's tastes. KHIII has segments where the gameplay is entirely different for a time but it's woven into the gameplay pretty evenly to where it never becomes too noticeable; the pirate ship in the Caribbean, every world has some kind of minigame.\n\nAnother thing, KHIII absolutely gives you a ton of tools to use in battle but unfortunately their usefulness tends to vary. Apart from Critical difficulty, magic is pretty overpowered and gives the player little reason to use other tools unless you just want to for variety or to style on the enemies. The summons are pretty effective regardless. I feel like KHII encouraged you to use different abilities because different things were effective in different situations while KHIII has certain tools that are super effective throughout leaving the rest to languish. \n\nSimilarly, arguably the most useful tools are locked into a system that as far as I know is still considered largely random. The meter you have to build with combos and magic to use the keyblade transformations and grand magic doesn't seem to fill uniformly and doesn't always give you what you're hoping for. On top of that, the attractions are an almost entirely random occurrence tied to attacking certain enemies. This is what's particularly frustrating for me. Like, these are tools I'd like more direct control over when I get to use them. Storing and swapping the keyblade transformations is super neat, even though I don't really care for the idea of the keyblade transforming in the first place.\n\nAlot of it is going to come down to personal tastes, I think. KH games all have different play styles and gimmicks and it's kind of a toss-up if it's going to be what you're looking for. In my case though, I liked how KH2 built upon the original KH and expected the growth into KH3 to be along the same lines. I wasn't especially fond of the mechanics that the spin-off's introduced. I didn't hold it against those games because they were on systems that necessitated a more limited control scheme but I also wasn't expecting flowmotion and shotlocks to return in KH3.  \n\n\nTL;DR It might just be a matter of taste and KH is all over the map with this stuff."", 'Thanks for posting!

Just because I (and many others) point out the inherent prejudice in your speech, doesn’t mean we are trying to be a victim for other people.

Occasionally it pops up and it's annoying.  I do check this place every day (usually) but maybe I'm instinctively not clicking on the dodgy ones?\n\nMy use case here is to keep up to date with AMD related news because I switched 2 years ago after 10 years with Intel.  No hate, I literally just care about multi core performance and better power consumption for long 100% usage workloads.  My last Intel CPU has been great and still works well to this day.  I now have 2 AMD systems and love that it's so easy to switch parts between the two for troubleshooting or upgrades, even if the parts are from different generations.\n\nAnd also check to see what settings people are using, in terms of voltages, manual vs stock vs PBO.  Manual RAM timings, silicon lottery numbers (when people share their personal results after building the system).  I save a lot of these resources to my HDD for future reference.  And also.. when other people ask for help, if I know something, sharing that info and returning the favor.  Because when I first joined here, I knew pretty much nothing about the AMD way of optimizing the system.  With Intel I always used XMP, but with Ryzen you get better results by manually optimizing it yourself.  And people helped a lot in terms of sharing what they know.\n\nI do agree with you.. that AMD users.. a large group of them do have a chip on their shoulder.  For many years their products were rubbish, and it's only been in the last few years that they've really transitioned into a competitive and now premium brand.  It used to be a value based budget option only.  Also.. in 20 years, the only CPUs I've ever had fail have been AMD.  But yeah, lately they have become really popular and more mainstream, and I have noticed a change here in the last 12 months.  But I rarely think of this place as toxic though, otherwise I would avoid it and find the resources elsewhere.\n\nI don't understand the whole emotional side of the tech world.  Tech things are based on specs.  It's very robotic and mathematical.  I do care about anti competitive or anti consumer practices, but I've never understood the whole tribal thing in terms of Team Red vs Team Blue.  I use Samsung SSD's because I love their cloning software, the reliability and the speeds (not so much the prices, but if you buy during cashback periods it makes it easier).  It has nothing to do with being Team Black.\n\nTLDR version.. I think what you might be talking about is a lot of AMD users have inferiority complex.

jm8vz8,“Highlighter on top of text” issue respond from GoodNotes!,"A few days ago I wrote an email to GoodNotes about highlighter being on top of my texts and especially making the text underneath look dull. 
If you searched for an answer and couldn’t find one, here’s their respond: 

“I'm afraid the highlighting stroke has always been on top. If you use a highlighter color that's transparent, then it will take a huge number of strokes to eventually block the text it highlights, thus giving the appearance that the highlighting is behind the text. But if you try using a highlighter color that's more opaque, it will take just a few strokes to eventually cover the text. That means highlighting strokes are always on the top layer.

On dark paper, the general brightness of the paper is now detected and the strokes are adjusted accordingly to increase their visibility. Previously, if you drew or highlighted a white stroke on dark paper, the stroke would be almost invisible until you erased it and we got a large number of complaints about it. I realize this change isn't ideal, especially to users like you, and we'll think about introducing a ""behind-text"" highlighting mode so that more users can benefit.

Technically speaking for light papers, it blends with the text rather than behind the text. It just looks like ""behind the text"" for the blended effect. For dark papers, due to the limitations of Apple blend mode, the behaviour on the dark paper is currently the best we have come up so far.”","['I do really like that the highlighters show up more on dark paper but this is still annoying because if I use dark paper with white pen, the highlight changes the color of the white writing to a light blue or whatever lol I really hope they can implement this 🤞', 'But you can use lasso tool with activated - Select only text , it will allow to you select and move only text, or you can make same with highlighter, I think there no big difference where is highlighter situated ;-)']","“Highlighter on top of text” issue respond from GoodNotes!A few days ago I wrote an email to GoodNotes about highlighter being on top of my texts and especially making the text underneath look dull.

It’s very annoying and really prevents me from using the app nicely. Also the laser pointer is like watching a Power Point with one slide each 6 seconds.","[""How much data do you have on GoodNotes?

l132c1,New thoughts on pen thickness settings.,I'm now of the opinion the size of the paper dictates the sizes of the pen thickness. Since most pdf journals being sold on Etsy use A4 templates writing with thick pen sizes will cause you to waste too much space to write simple sentences. I discovered the right size to use when using the zoom box is 0.45mm. However at regular style writing without the zoom box the right size to use from my point of view is still 1.2mm. The in between level is still 0.7mm. The only problem is when using the 0.45mm size is this causes writing to become too small to be legible. The only workaround is to either zoom onto the small text area or enlarge the text manually.,['I personally always use 3 mm.

Can’t speak for the iPad Pro since I’ve only got the Air but in terms of writing on PDFs that teachers give you, being able to tag and mark up various types of questions by topic it’s brilliant.

Any textbook I’ve needed to reference I’ve just took pictures of the pages in Uni or at home. For questions and solutions I use screenshooting and annotating a lot - especially with exam style questions or professional body definitions and explanations etc where the original source matters and I don’t want to take away from the original format. \n\nIn terms of iPads I’ve had no issues running anything on my iPad Air and it’s nice and light to carry about back when in person classes were a thing.', 'yeah  you just need to make sure it\'s a PDF!

However, if it’s just for note taking, I think you’re fine with the Air.

But the truth was that until they had learned to know themselves, to accept themselves, to work out their demons, and to make their own decisions about what they wanted, their relationship was doomed to fail. This is what makes it so tragic. If they had met at the right time, they might have worked out. Each knew it and that's what made their moment even more heartbreaking. They knew they were damaged and used the other to fill a void.

They do this regularly every week, couple of weeks, or month. \n\nThat’s how they handle their internal business requests for features. They say “added to the list”, do some math, and then prioritize it. Usually that means it is put nowhere in range of any near-term work, and you are blown off.\n\nThis is a terrible way to interact with a customer because it is non-transparent, which violates the values of most software development, and it is misleading and deceitful. \n\nInstead, they should publish their plans for all new features for the coming year, let you know what those priorities are, who they are for, and why they are working on them. If you make a request, they should honestly answer “We have that on our list, but not this year and maybe not next” so you can grieve and go away.\n\nPeople will be refreshing the App Store every day wondering if their latest reddit post or tweet has their favorite feature in it. \n\nBut don’t feel too bad.

As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you\'re stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you are violating PP ToS.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

mgtz7q,More Customizable App,"Hello there,

I was just wondering, if i am alone with this wish.

I used to be a onenote user and really appreciated the amount of settings i can tweak to make the program look/work/feel exactly like i want it to. I got myself an 12.9 inch ipad pro and i am kinda disappointed by the lack of features of goodnotes.
Don't get me wrong, goodnotes works great and the feeling of writing with it is great imo, but still. I would like to have more colors via quick access, not just three, maybe some sort of better zoom feature, so i can set some presets for zooming in/out. Also the way the zoom-box works kinda disappointed me. I can't move it wherever i want, if i want it to be on the top of the page, i have to put the menu on the bottom? Why isn't the zoombox like ""a normal window"" which i can place wherever i want it to be? Or have it like splitscreen, when the ipad is horizontally on my desk?

I was just wondering, if i am alone with this wish.

I used to be a onenote user and really appreciated the amount of settings i can tweak to make the program look/work/feel exactly like i want it to. I got myself an 12.9 inch ipad pro and i am kinda disappointed by the lack of features of goodnotes.
Don't get me wrong, goodnotes works great and the feeling of writing with it is great imo, but still. I would like to have more colors via quick access, not just three, maybe some sort of better zoom feature, so i can set some presets for zooming in/out. Also the way the zoom-box works kinda disappointed me. I can't move it wherever i want, if i want it to be on the top of the page, i have to put the menu on the bottom? Why isn't the zoombox like ""a normal window"" which i can place wherever i want it to be? Or have it like splitscreen, when the ipad is horizontally on my desk?


In general, do you guys also feel this way? Maybe not specifically to the things i pointed out, but other things that just are ""too restricted"" for the lack of a better term?More Customizable App",2021-03-31 00:29:34,Question,1.0,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodNotes/comments/mgtz7q/more_customizable_app/

Is there any reason to get it over what I’ve been using which is a combination of OneNote and PDF Expert. The reason I’m considering another app is because the export function has been a pain recently for my calculus notes. So what do you guys think, are there any major differences between the apps?","['I own both good notes and notability and like notability better. It is definitely worth it to buy the app, I have hardly used good notes but I’m okay with that since I’ve got so much value from notability and would have bought it ten times over. \n\nI’d say look more into notability and go for whichever takes your fancy, you won’t regret it :)', 'Appreciate the reply. Think I’m gonna check out notability, specially since it’s on sale', 'I cant speak for notibility because I don’t own it, but I do own goodnotes and I love it, there’s so much to do and a lot of freedom, that being said don’t get too overwhelmed it takes a bit of practice to ge to your favorite note taking paper and pen! I’d say it’s worth it, makes my school life a lot easier', 'Thanks for your input. How would you compare it with OneNote?', ""Goodnotes is more stable. Notability is more likely to dump all of your notes on your one week before an exam. \n\nGoodnotes has less fluid, complicated UI. Notability's is better.\n\nThey are about even for features, with Goodnotes being cited as having better file organization.\n\nOne Note is hot garbage by comparison to Goodnotes."", 'For class notes, GoodNotes is vastly superior to OneNote as long as you don’t need decent collaboration and are using it as a notebook (to capture original handwritten content) rather than a binder (collection of existing documents like handouts etc, at which Evernote still excels). \nOneNote is for me ridiculously unstable and unreliable. It is impossible to get information out of it in any usable form - printing or sharing. I never understand why people love it so much and I’ve tried so many times as a fully paid up O365 user to like it. Apple notes is far better these days. \n\nI’m a self employed consultant and I’m also studying one day a week - I use GoodNotes for my course notes and it’s been great. Everything else is in Apple\nNotes these days.', 'Thanks for your input. What about compared to notability?', 'They’re both good. Notability is simpler and I prefer the inking tools; however I’m using a Cornell template for my notes and GoodNotes is better from a templates perspective. It also has a good outlining feature for larger notebooks. Notability has good syncing with audio which has been invaluable for stakeholder interviews and research, so I use both - they’re not expensive to me. \n\nIf I’m honest, they’re both very capable and the principle difference comes down to templates and organisation (GoodNotes) vs audio and inking (notability).', 'I think both the goodnotes and the notability app is worth the money. I use them both, but for different things. Notability is great for taking notes while reading or in lecture, and goodnotes is great for more neat notetaking and digital planning. I use both apps daily in my studying :)']","Considering buying the appHi guys I’ve been considering getting good notes 5 for a while now.

n5czur,Pen Colour/Thickness Profiles,"Hi All,

Been using GoodNotes for the last couple of months to take my office notes digital so I can scribble things quickly and then rewrite more neatly later on.

Also started using GoodNotes for personal journals etc and think it would be great to have different profiles set up so you can choose your Pen Thickness and colour options via Profiles.

I've submitted this as [a feedback request](https://feedback.goodnotes.com/forums/191274-customer-suggestions-for-goodnotes/suggestions/43140525-pen-colour-thickness-profiles) on the GoodNotes forums so would love for people to give this a vote to get the visibility.

n5f1o6,Glitches in the writing....,"From the video, I am having 2 issues with goodnotes right now. 

I am using an iPad Pro 11"", Apple Pencil 2. Changed to a fresh tip just to confirm it's not the pencil, tried notability and notes just to confirm its not the screen protector/ipad screen itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 1: if I write something or highlight something, and immediately switch to the eraser, it will not be able to detect the last thing I wrote. like how I could not delete the highlight until I tapped on the screen (you see me tapping the screen and the eraser turns up on screen at 0:13) then it would ""recognise"" the highlight

Issue 2: the glitching!! gets on my nerves and honestly was the reason why I (had to) switch to notability. i use goodnotes to project my notes in my classroom and it was causing glitches every few lines I wrote. I have been using goodnotes for over a year and this has only started happening this year. Happens everytime I scroll after writing something, the last character I wrote will always glitch.

n9aq71,thinking about getting an ipad...,"... to take digital notes for school. i start university this fall, so I have enough time to save for the iPad Air. My only question is whether you feel that it’s worth it to take digital notes. I for one love how the layout of digital notes look and the convenience of it all.

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!","['I switched to digital notes during my second year of college and as such have six semesters and three years of experience with them, and I can say I GREATLY prefer them over physical notes.  The ability to search for things in-text but still have the option to draw diagrams makes them very useful.  I also like them for future reference, because I have all of the notebooks from my last three years in college and none of them from my first two, and I can access them both on my iPad and any other device which can access Google Drive.', 'That certainly sounds convenient. Knowing me, I’m Prly gonna end up buying the iPad, I just wanna hear stories from other people about this', ""I love it! It takes some time to getting used to, the writing feeling especially, but it's very practical. You can access your notes from literally anywhere if you Auto synch them as a pdf (as well with/instead of via iCloud, I do both) so if you just want to look something up but don't have your iPad with you, your notes are on your Cloud. It also saves so much paper. My brother, who is also doing online school but doesn't take notes digitally, has to print out sooo much and I can just import it and write on the iPad. Also being able to search your notes is so practical\n\nI really like it and spend so much time on my iPad I'd say it's a must have for me"", ""I switched over to writing my notes on a ipad earlier this year. I was initially concerned whether or not I'll like it but so far it's working fantastically for me. I can't recommend it enough"", 'I bought an iPad Air a couple months back to take my work notes digital and I only wish I did it sooner. My work recently became very note intensive and I’ve gone through umpteen notepads since lockdown began and having to rifle back to find old notes was becoming unmanageable. With GoodNotes you can search your handwritten notes which is awesome!\n\nSuch an amazing feeling with an Apple Pencil and a matte screen protector.\n\n100% go for it. You won’t regret it', 'Honestly having an iPad for college completely changed my college experience. I switched to an iPad for notetaking my third semester in college after killing so many trees printing out powerpoint after powerpoint to take notes on. The iPad completely changed this: no more hauling around notebooks and binders, no more losing pencils and refilling ink in pens... it’s just awesome. As a perfectionist but also someone who loves writing in pen, I would constantly be stressed out in fear of messing up my notes and having to scratch out work on paper. On the iPad, you can just undo it and forget it ever happened! I’d highly recommend the iPad Air for notetaking and choosing Goodnotes :)', 'Okay, thank you so much 😊', 'I def gotta get it now', ""I wish I hadn't finished college yet so I could use my iPad lol. In the last year I took notes in Evernote with my Moto G4."", 'I started digital note-taking in my last year of school. I used a Lenovo Yoga with onenote to write stuff down. I mostly write mathematical stuff so having a pen for these is a no-brainer for me. I gave many people advice on digital note-taking, which device is the best one for them etc, and i boiled it down to a few questions you should ask yourself :\n\n1. Do you ACTUALLY need digital notes? What is the real benefit of making them because it\'s kind of hyped now and many people just ""do some scetches"" or just ""write that one equation down"", for those it is probably not the best thing to do. Don\'t forget: Digital note-taking is expensive. Every device which is capable of taking digital notes with a pen is relatively expensive, ipads (especially the pro-line), laptops which can be flipped(like the one i used) or laptop/tablet hybrids (like the surface pro).\n\n2. If you decide it\'s worth your money, pick a device that fits your needs. If you pretty much only use a pen (and have a ""real computer at hand) get an iPad, the pen is straight up the best in the game. If you also need some power on the go, get something like the yoga, it\'s a solid laptop with up to 8 cores, 32GB of ram, blablabla, depends on your needs and also if you use this as your only machine or as a secondary device.\n\n3. Maybe a normal laptop is just right for you? If you study something like languages, economics or law, you will be mostly writing texts. So having a good keyboard is a necessity. In that case, a normal laptop would be pretty much all you need. Be honest with yourself and don\'t just buy something because ""well XY is using this for his studies so it must work for me"".\n\n4. Do you have the skills to actually benefit from the digital world? I know, this sounds harsh because ""of course i have those, i mean this is the modern world and i live inside of it"". But believe it or not, many of my colleagues just don\'t have the skill set to efficiently take digital notes. Not just copy/paste, but you have to adjust your work flow, keep your data in a useful structure, make backups (seriously, if anyone reads this and doesn\'t have a backup of his/her notes, make one right now) and many other things like ""how does my colleague get this thing"", what if i want to collab with people etc etc etc... \n\n\nPaper with a pen let\'s you do everything you can imagine, but every application, every device you use is designed by people who are thinking different than you. I got really frustrated while trying to find THE PERFECT App for taking notes until i figured out, not a single app can do everything i want it to.\nI still use a good ol\' paper-notebook for brainstorming, just because it gives me the opportunity to do exactly what i want, no ""super smooth curves"" or ""super clean images"". Some things are just messy in and of itself, and nothing is better at capturing your thoughts that a piece of paper and a pen.\n\n\nMaybe this sounds like a rant, i am really not, but maybe this should be a step into seeing the downsides of digital note-taking and not just the beautiful future we want it to be...\n\nIf you want some further advice, just pm me, budget, usage are pretty important factors (as i already mentioned) so with more information about your future use case etc maybe i can be a little more helpful', ""It definitely is, it's helped my organisation so much. No more forgetting notes/textbooks to class as I only need to remember my iPad, and no more breaking my back with said books in my backpack."", 'I finished my first degree by mostly writing on paper. At least during the lectures. I usually wrote a study guide on my laptop but it wasn\'t perfect. I always wished for a way to make it pretty and efficient by highlighting definitions in boxes or just highlight with a digital highlighter. To be honest I think I would have been happy with paper notes but I always wished for an iPad it was just too expensive I thought.\nIn my last year I used a surface thinking I would have a laptop that\'s easy to carry around for writing stuff with a keyboard but I also wanted to take digital handwritten notes. My biggest problem with taking digital hand written notes on the surface was that I was using one note and it just didn\'t work for me. I\'ve searched ages for an app that would let you annotated PDFs and also let\'s you put pages ""in between"" because my studying often required answering questions in the scripts. All the apps I found were prescription based and thats\'s just unnecessary expensive imo. I just hated that I had three binders for math because I wanted to have the questions of the lecture of my homework and of studying separately. With goodnotes you can have these different binders all in one place.\n\nI also want to highlight the functions of digital notes during covid-19. My university requires us to upload our homework or work in teams online. And it\'s just so much easier to share your screen or send an email with you homework without scanning it first.\nSooo long story short my boyfriend bought an iPad and i used it everytime he didn\'t. I loved it so much that I bought my own and i regret I didn\'t do that earlier.', 'I agree with everyone who is saying that it takes time to get used to! I always swore that I would never make the switch. I lugged around my pens, mildliners, and Moleskines in college because I was determined not to go digital. Then I started thinking about grad school and realized that things like books and articles could be exported into Goodnotes and annotated, and I caved. I would never EVER switch back. I love digital notes SO much. \n\nedit: (I have the iPad Pro)\n\nedit #2 lol I truly never read other poster’s comments before posting my own. I skim them. This is in response to mathematical Lenovo user. \n\nFirstly, I would be wary of any Microsoft user who is warning you off buying a Mac product. In my experience, it’s 80/20 that they have a strong anti-Mac bias. (I used exclusively Microsoft products pre-2016)\n\nSecondly, I have a Macbook Pro 2016 and an iPad Pro May 2020 model. These are my two primary devices. My use for them will be different from our mathematical friend over at Lenovo. Still, I’ll say this from my own experience—I am shocked just often I reach for my iPad after years of using my Macbook for everything. Now, this will not be your case. The iPad Pro can replace some functions of the Macbook Pro, but even then, it can’t substitute itself for one. However, with a keyboard and a mouse, you’re a hell of a lot more equipped to run the iPad as a “Mobile Oval,” to lovingly quote from “Veep.” It’s your presidential replacement on the go, and from what I understand, even the iPad Air can handle that. (Isn’t the Gen 2 Apple Pencil now compatible with the Air?) \n\nSecondly.Two, if you’ll take a recommendation from me, ditch the stupid keyboard case and cut straight for the Logitech super slim keyboard. It’s waterproof and weighs very little. I love mine. Get a cheap case from Amazon or something. The keyboard cases are ridiculously overpriced. The Logitech keyboard is something like $70 and holds a charge forever. \n\nThirdly, I don’t know what your learning style is, what your major might be, or what else you may want to consider, but digital note-taking is an excellent idea for people with significant reading loads. I was an English education major, and I’ll be attending a master’s program for journalism this fall. I foresaw a hefty reading load. That means I had to lug around several literary anthologies, print out hundreds of short stories etc., etc. It would’ve saved me money to buy the iPad in the first place. \n\nFourthly, I do want to point out that you shouldn’t be buying the iPad because of what you see from this trend in digital note-taking. It’s very pretty, and that is definitely why I love it, but it is a considerable expense. I am impulsive by nature. If you are wise, you may want to have someone sit down with you and work out the figures. \n\nI would say I printed well over 8k pages while in undergrad. That’s for sure lowballing. I know for one class alone, I had to have printed at least a thousand. And that was one single semester. Weigh printer costs against what you would save. I don’t know. Maybe you will break even, and perhaps it’ll be significantly more expensive to buy the iPad. I’m not a math person. \n\nFifth, and finally, I think it’s essential that you have something to look forward to going into college. I think it’s worth noting that I use my iPad every single day and have used it almost every day since I purchased it. Now, granted, I did buy it during quarantine, so that’s not a perfect example. However, I do use Goodnotes every day, and I am currently not working and am not attending school until the fall. \n\nSome highlights:\n\n* I love digital planning now. I was never a consistent planner before, but now I try to plan out my week (or at least jot some things down). I bought my planner from Three65Planners on Etsy, and I highly recommend it. It’s loaded with hyperlinks and templates. \n* Organization. I have severe ADHD, and my organization has always been “throw things anywhere.” Goodnotes’ search feature is fantastic, and I have tons of folders. \n* Color options. I have 150 pen presets, and 48 highlighter presets on Goodnotes. Think about lugging around 150 pens and 48 highlighters, a huge planner, and 70 journals. That would suck. \n* Stickers. Digital stickers are super fun. I have over a thousand digital stickers saved! \n\n\nA downside:\n* Learning to write on an iPad sucks. I highly recommend getting a palm rejection glove. My handwriting looked like a third-grader when I first got my iPad.', 'Yes go for it, personally it completely changed the game and my grades have improved vastly. I have the ipad 7th gen and the first apple pencil, i also have a keyboard case from amazon i use if i need it but i mainly write everything down. I like goodnotes because i am able to access my notes &amp; digital textbooks on my phone and on my laptop through google drive.', 'From an old response to this question but -\n\n“I would highly recommend it. I got one my second year of college and haven’t looked back. I honestly forget what it’s like to take notes on physical paper. It’s super convenient having all your searchable notes, pdf textbooks, lecture slides, and multiple colored pens and highlighters of all different sizes all in one tiny place. I’ve compared some of my notes since getting my iPad to before and it’s night and day in terms of readability and structure. It’s kind of weird to say but digital note taking makes taking notes “fun”. I could go on forever about all the benefits but there are a few cons.\nFrom my experience, I’ve encountered a very small amount of things that made me say “ugh” since the switch. With everything technology, there will be occasional issues and bugs (e.g. documents disappearing, random spazzes when writing with the Apple Pencil, etc), but these have happened to me maybe a handful of times. Plus, there are plenty of ways to mitigate the damages of these bugs.\nI’ve motivated like 4-5 of my friends to switch to digital note taking and they’ve enjoyed the switch. One of my friends has atrocious handwriting and him switching helped him create more readable notes to reference later. Just remember it works for some people better than others. I know people who’d rather take paper notes because the feel and it helps them retain information better. If you have an Apple Store near you or a friend who has an iPad, give it a try. Copy some of your handwritten notes over on the iPad and see what you think. Try to improve them in the process to get a feel of ways it might help make your notes better. Good luck!”', ""You'll definitely get biased opinions in this subreddit, but I agree with what others have said here! Some of the features like OCR for searching handwriting and ease of annotating preexisting documents are just irreplaceable."", ""I wonder what percentage of school notes look like what ends up posted here for our neatness gratification. I for one cannot make anything look really attractive unless I have the ability to spend time doing and redoing which I cannot imagine you'd have in a lecture or seminar setting taking notes from a live speaker. Redoing them is of course an option, so if you're ok doing that and in split screen and are confident you'd be hitting the goals you have in mind..."", 'I did digital through grad school, granted it was on an HP that had pen capabilities. Scanned my books in on my all in one. Years later, have my notes and things anywhere I go. Love.', 'Absolute game changer. It’s so convenient. On top of that I’m more organized than I’ve ever been. It’s absolutely worth every penny. Do it.', 'Love using my iPad Air for school. It’s so convenient to have all your notes and school-related documents in one place while also not having to worry about printing, organizing, and bringing them everywhere. I also download my textbooks and it’s so helpful to not have to bring many books wherever I go. Makes assignments and life in general easier!', 'How do you recommend backing up your digital notes?', ""I had similar thoughts about ipads and ended up buying an Ipad Air (4th Gen.) a few months ago and I think it's 120% worth it. I love how I can load the lecture slides and take notes on top of them, and how it reduces the pain on my right wrist. You don't need a pro, air is good enough for students imo."", ""Buying an ipad has totally changed the game for me, note-taking and studying goes to a whole new level.I've been using it for 2 years now and i feel its the best device i ever bought and i would recommend it to every student who has more of notes taking and making work in studies. Best part is that we can integrate images with the notes and annotate it."", 'I’m such a paper and pen girl, I journal and do traditional art and just love doing stuff on paper with my beloved pens, BUT. School notes? No. Digital only. I used to have an ipad pro 12”9, but recently switched to a normal 10”2 ipad. I love how personalized you can get on the go and don’t have to take 4 notebooks with you if you wanna learn.\n\nMy comment is so unclear, because I just woke up, lmao, short summary: Love the ipad for notes, really useful, but I only have classes at home (even before covid) so I don’t have to worry abt time pressure.', 'I back them up in different ways:\n\nI have a copy in my self-hosted cloud and one on the hard drive of my pc.\n\nYou can also read something about ""basic backup safety"" and will find some good ideas', 'I only got the iPad for digital notes in my 4th year of university and honestly I’m so mad I didn’t do this earlier!! It’s saved so much time with organising notes and makes it easier to study because you don’t see the massive pile of notes and papers on your desk. I initially was worried about missing paper and stationary and all that but taking notes on the iPad and reading is so much more convenient especially if you like to study in libraries or coffee shops. You can also make them really pretty and nice if you enjoy that. It will save you so much time especially because in university the information they give you is just all over the place and they love giving lots of slides and handouts so I definitely recommend using an iPad to make it more convenient and easy. Hope I’ve helped a bit let me know if you have questions I love speaking about iPads hahah :))', 'Also I forgot to mention, it depends on what course you’re studying so it might be useful for you if you need to learn lots of things or write stuff out a ton. However, if you’re taking a course where it’s mostly writing ideas and essays and things like that, an iPad may not be as useful to you. So it might be worth doing a semester without an iPad and then seeing how you feel around December time?', 'Hey, the lenovo-guy here :D\n\nI don\'t really get your first point...

It easily takes 2-3 GB of ram on my 8GB M1 MacBook Air. (I know the performance is trash on Intel Macs as well but it is actually usable on Apple silicon) 

This is not an issue on iPads because the iPadOS handels Ram differently. There, the least needed app is just removed from Ram completely when ram is needed (with no mercy). MacOS has more mercy which it honestly shouldn't have when there are a lot of apps that don't handle ram responsibly, like GoodNotes and Notability.Ram mangement is trash!",2021-05-25 21:10:37,Review,1.0,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodNotes/comments/nl04ow/ram_mangement_is_trash/

It was like 11 days or so? \n\nThere will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.\n\nThere are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?\n\nThere will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  \n\n I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....\n\nThere are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. \nConfidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!\n\nThe really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.\n\nAfter that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. \n You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. \n\nDont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. \n\nI am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.\n\nLemme know if you got any questions."", 'What up', 'Refresh your browser it should pop up', '**Welcome to the Broadcast!

Even if there's a template you don't see included with the base app, there are a lot of sites and users who have made additional page templates that can easily be added to the templates gallery in the app.\n\n3) The new Elements feature allows users to save frequently drawn images, diagrams, or just any stickers you want to be able to easily add to any document you're working on.\n\n4) Laser pointer for when you're sharing your screen\n\n5) Adding and modifying images is much more streamlined\n\n6) PDFs can be added as their own documents rather than just being embeds (that one could be either better or worse depending on the situation)\n\nand the list can go on."", 'I will say that if ""endless scrolling"" is what you are looking for, Notability is closer to that but also has a good amount of the features I listed above including individual sheets in a document.', '[deleted]', 'Watch [this video that compares Goodnotes to Apple Notes on iPadOS 14.

I don’t know why people don’t just use Apple notes? It has better selections of writing pens, is very simple and has a clean UI. This app doesn’t not even have a pencil ✏️ like the notes app. 

The main reason I wanted something else is on notes you can’t zoom on the page.

ntud8l,"Just converted to GoodNotes from LiquidText, ?apparent problem already?","Hi there, I hope you're all doing well.

I've been a long time user of LiquidText (LT) but have had ongoing problems with shifting research papers in/out/between LT and various conventional file locations such as ""On my iPad"" and ""Dropbox"". I have literally hundreds of pdf files collected over many years. With that context...

I've purchased GoodNotes (GN) for my iPad and downloaded the MacPro app GN app, too. Based on comments in various places, it \_appeared\_ that GoodNotes could handle my big (number of individual) research papers use case. Both platforms are fully up-to-date with their respective OS updates.

I started by loading files beginning with the year ""2021"" within the GN app on my MacPro. (The filename doesn't matter, I assume, it's just a way of organizing in the creaky old file system approach to file mgmt.) I saw the files appear in my iPad instance of GN. Yay! Then I decided to create folders named ""2021"", ""2020"", etc. I did this on my MacPro. I have yet to see those folder names appear on my iPad. I still see the original load of files names beginning with ""2021"" on my iPad. I see the folders with year names on my MacPro instance of GN. I've successfully moved the initially bulk loaded files into the ""2021"" subfolder and bulk loaded appropriate files into the sub-year folders on the MacPro from where they were located on DropBox.

I have yet to see anything different than the initially loaded files (via MacPro GN) on my iPad GN. I've closed the GN apps on both MacPro and iPad. Still no change on the iPad GN Documents view. I've tried examining every visible option on the iPad GN screen. I don't see a &lt;- (back arrow) to go ""up"" a level on the iPad GN Document screen. I don't see the folders I created within the MacPro GN app in the iPad GN app.

Any ideas? This morning was the iPadOS 14.6 update. Could there be a bug created in GN by that update? Anyone else see this problem?

I guess I'm going to try restarting my iPad to see if that fixes the problem with the iPad GoodNotes app I've got. Any other thoughts or suggestions very welcome. TIA","[""Update after power off/on my iPad, the folders are there now. Is this how it is supposed to work? If a change is made on one platform you have to power on/off the other to have the change take effect? Is this a number of files moved thing (it's been over an hour since I started file manipulation)? Just a co-incidence I powered off/on and finally saw the maybe 150 pdf files spread over 4 folders show up? Maybe it's just an initial transfer problem (moving from one app, LT, to GoodNotes)? I wouldn't under normal daily use be moving that many files around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other people moved their long term (\\~4 years) project from something else to GoodNotes and see this problem? Was it ok after you entered normal use mode?"", 'It sometimes takes a while for my iPad to be able to see new files/folders created on my mac, I think it’s a problem with the Files app itself rather than GoodNotes specifically. If I try to import something into GoodNotes but the file is missing, I look up the info on an existing document (press and hold to bring up the info option) and that usually makes the missing documents appear, presumably by forcing a sync. Hope this helps!', 'Thanks for replying. I\'ve noticed something similar. \n\nNow that I\'m further along in the migration of my work from LT to GoodNotes I find the following helps:\n\n\\- The first creation of a folder takes time to migrate between platforms (for my instance &gt; 1 hour and I don\'t think it would have happened without the re-boot). Subsequent addition of new folders on one platform appeared readily on the second platform. In my case, the two platforms were MacPro and iPad.\n\n\\- When moving many files, watch for the little cloud icon and its internal symbols. If the within cloud symbol is the roundabout symbol, it\'s working, hang in there until the cloud icon disappears. If the symbol inside the little cloud is an exclamation mark, it will likely need a little help by attempting to open the file. I think this is similar to what u/pennells is referring to with ""press and hold"". When I would select one of the (many) cloud-with-! labeled files, the directory of files inside GoodNotes would ""blink"" and the rest of the files would settle out followed by their cloud-! icons winking out. I\'m going with ""forcing a sync"" as suggested by u/pennells. \n\nNow I\'m moving old work out of LT. Alas, it\'s one file at a time. Part of my issues with LT are prominent with this effort: each file has to be addressed with what I\'m presented with as options from LT. Sometimes I can transfer directly into the GoodNotes app and sometimes LT doesn\'t present that choice and I have to output to an external file folder.\n\nI really hope the Files app particulars are better managed by GoodNotes than I saw with LiquidText. I guess we\'ll see.']","Just converted to GoodNotes from LiquidText, ?apparent problem already?Hi there, I hope you're all doing well.

I find myself often copying almost entire pages/paragraphs from my textbook near word for word, rather than being able to effectively summarise information. If anyone has any links to guides on note taking I'd really appreciate them (not Cornell though :&lt; something about that style pisses me off even just thinking about it).

Hope you're all having a good day :)","['Aesthetic notes are pleasing to read later. I loved those notes too, but I think it they are the result of perfectionism. I make my notes only okay, with readable handwriting, some alignment of stuff/formulas/etc and some highlighting. That’s it. Rest is only our desire to make beautiful notes. If you’re wondering, I fill a Goodnotes standard paper in about 30 minutes. Would be 45 to 55 for A4. Don’t spend a lot of time decorating them. \nAs for the copying, you don’t need to clone your textbook in a beautiful manner, the best way of taking notes is summarising. I don’t have any resources except for YouTube Videos by Ali Abdaal, Anas Nuur Ali, and KharmaMedic. \nHere’s a tip, in a language, you have some keywords and some grammar terms. Differentiating between them will help knowing what’s important and what’s not.', 'Hi, hope you’re having a good day too! \n\nI use A4 size paper with the dark background, usually dotted or square template. \n\nI’ve been using GoodNotes for 3 year-ish. At the beginning, I took my notes very slowly because I tried to make it look pretty. But now, I went through pages pretty fast. \n\nWhat I did was simplifying the kind of notes i write. Instead of focusing on making it look pretty, I just wrote whatever quickly using 1 pen style, and highlighting / circling the important parts quickly.

I would use s highlighter during revision to highlight important points."", 'Depending on how many calls I have or how long they are, I scribble my notes and probably go through a page every 20-30 mins\n\nI scribble a lot and space things out so I can write additional things in between if needed.\n\nAt a later time, I then go back and rewrite my notes in a neater way and help condense them down again. \n\nAlso a great way to refresh my memory when going over my notes again and reminds me of any action items I’m yet to do', 'I would say it depends on what you’re taking notes for. \n\nWith regards to my notes, I just annotate the lecture slides and add blank pages for summaries which helped me move away from trying to have the most aesthetically pleasing notes.', 'i focus on getting the info down first, then highlight/add pictures/change text color/reformat later. it’s a lot faster than constantly stopping to fiddle w the looks', 'I think it depends on what type of notes you’re making. If it’s just jotting stuff down like during a lecture, then it probably should not take you a lot of time. \nBut if it’s going back and trying to actually learn the information through note-taking, like making a study guide, it would of course take longer.\nI also like my study guides to be aesthetically pleasing - colors should match, words/images should align well, etc. However, most of my note taking time is spent on trying to digest and rephrase the info into sth concise that I could understand. When it feels like I’m spending extra time making notes, I’m actually re-reading the material many times and thinking it through. Also I feel like writing stuff down helps me retain it better so there’s that. What I like about digital note taking is you can always use the lasso tool to move stuff around, so I rearrange the layout only after I’m done with the entire page.\nHand-writing notes does take extra time though, I can never do it for all my courses. So I choose one or two most challenging ones and hand write notes for those.

You\'d have to show some proof, but she isn\'t an idiot. She doesn\'t want any more of her troops to die.\n\nIf the only requirement for a domain of dread is a decent IQ and a desire to be left alone, then there should be thousands of domains, or the minimum requirements for the darklords hating you are are ""not a saint &amp; extremely stubborn."" which sums up a lot of people.', ""I'm fine.

Not that those games aren't still great, but it would have been more natural for Kiryu to have passed the torch YEARS ago, instead of always being dragged back into the plot. Yeah the series has had other shared protagonists which is a good thing, but Kiryu being there just steals the spotlight from what should be the next Generation, to the point they needed to make Yakuza 6 entirely about just Kiryu again, to FINALLY move on from this character.

You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.\n\n*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that elicit the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from habituating. Therefore, avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain novel, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Moreover, avoidance tends to generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*\n\nIf your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly carefully expose yourself to situations that you know give you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print.
